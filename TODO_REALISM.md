# UKSFTA Universal Realism - Tactical Roadmap

Status: **Phase 5 Complete**

## ✅ Completed (Integrated)
- **Modular Color Grading**: Detached from static configs; uses solar elevation and weather desaturation.
- **Dynamic Visual Noise**: Adaptive FilmGrain based on sun angle and precipitation.
- **Immersive Rain**: High-fidelity particle effects locally attached to player visor/vicinity.
- **Biome Desaturation**: Specific desaturation logic for Arctic/Arid environments.
- **Cloud Tinting Engine**: Kelvin-accurate shifts for sunrise/sunset.
- **Volumetric Fog**: Biome-specific height and decay interpolation.
- **Advanced Lightning**: Probabilistic side-effects and density control.
- **Lunar Grading**: Dynamic night grading based on moon intensity.
- **Enoch-Specific Scattering**: Implemented `WOODLAND` sub-biome with Livonia-style color grading.
- **Real-World Location Hook**: Latitude-based biome auto-detection (40-60° zones).
- **Dynamic Caustics**: Procedural underwater refraction and color shifting.
- **Thunderbolt Intensity**: Visceral white-out flashes synchronized with strikes.
- **Dynamic Wind Audio**: Procedural wind "howling" via localized sound logic.
- **Aerosol Density**: AI detection range scaling based on atmospheric obscuration.
- **Thermal Washout**: High-noon thermal degradation for Arid environments.
